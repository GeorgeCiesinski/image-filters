# Image Filters

An app to load images, alter the image properties such as brightness, contrast, and color model. You can also apply several different filters and save the image into an output folder.

## Motivation

I originally created this project to get a better understanding of OpenCV and TKinter.

## Built With

- OpenCV
- TKinter

## Features

- Loads images in openCV compatible formats, listed below
- Convert between RGB and grayscale
- Applies changes to the image brightness & contrast
- Applies different kind of filters such as sharpness, gaussian blur, and averaging
- Saves altered image to an output folder

## Compatible Formats

Although this project uses OpenCV and is theoretically able to open any OpenCV compatible image file, I decided to use the below files since they are the most common: 

- .bmp
- .dib
- .jpeg
- .jpg
- .jpe
- .png
- .pbm
- .pgm
- .ppm
- .sr
- .ras
- .tiff
- .tif
